# Data-Visualization
Data visualization is important to create meaningful information and decision making power. Data is useless if its not creating any meaning. This repository consists of Data Visualizations Python notebooks.

Facets is an open-source visualisation tool released by Google under the PAIR(People + AI Research) initiative. This tool helps us to understand and analyse the Machine Learning datasets. Facets consist of two visualisations, both of which help to drill down the data and provide great insights without much of work at userâ€™s end.
 
 **1. Facets Overview**
As the name suggests, this visualisation gives an overview of the entire dataset and gives a sense of the shape of each feature of the data. Facets Overview summarizes statistics for each feature and compares the training and test datasets.

**2. Facets Dive**

This feature helps the user to dive deep into the individual feature/observation of the data to get more information. It helps in interactively exploring large numbers of data points at once.
These visualizations are implemented as Polymer web components, backed by Typescript code and can be easily embedded into Jupyter notebooks or web pages.

## Pyviz
 Now, to choose the best tool for our job from amongst all of these is a bit tricky and confusing. PyViz tries to plug this situation. It helps to streamline the process of working with small and large datasets (from a few points to billions) in a web browser, whether doing exploratory analysis, making simple widget-based tools or building full-featured dashboards.
 **PyViz Ecosystem** 
PyViz is a coordinated effort to make data visualization in Python easier to use, learn and more powerful. PyViz consists of a set of open-source Python packages to work effortlessly with both small and large datasets right in the web browsers. PyViz is just the choice for something as simple as mere EDA or something as complex as creating a widget enabled dashboard.
